TODO: 
    LEARN TO USE BASIC FIGMA TO DESIGN THE FRONT END FIRST (4h) []
        have a initial design of the program -> the main features: 
            Input a bunch of destinations -> place it on the map -> select a few of those and show a route 

        -> basically just to up the mood of the project 

    WRITE A REACTJS FRONT END FOR THE INITIAL DESIGN (5h) []

    THE CORE IDEA OF THE APP: 
        -> Core idea: 
            map all the possible destination on the map and generate a good route for a date  

        Input all destination you wanna go. 
        -> Places all the go to spot on the map 

        Idea: Have different modes ?? (like: you choose places, choose based on budget, choose based on stuff like that)
        Choose the places you wanna go on that day.
        -> Calculate the best route to go.

        Have map like all the missions in Assasin's Creed 
        Can input budget when input the destination

        -> Have busmap route, recommendation better suited place (distance betweens spot and budget). 

        Have a web version and and android version 

        Can share the route to others 
        
    DECIDE WHAT FEATURES THE WEB APP WILL HAVE: 
        REGISTER, LOGIN, LOGOUT 
        USE GOOGLE MAP API FOR A MAP DISPLAY AND MAPPING STUFF

    WHAT TECHNOLOGY WILL WE USE IN THIS PROJECT ?? 
        WE WILL USE MERN STACK - @Current 
        TYPESCRIPT FOR BACKEND 
DONE:
